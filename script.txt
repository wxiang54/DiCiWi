Hello, we are The Yellow Alykinators and we'd like to present 


How many times hav

In 2015 alone, 2000 children were run over by cars, and thousands more lost.
The truth of the matter is, street safety is never guaranteed. Our children 
are vulnerable to all kinds of threats while walking alone, from kidnappings
to road accidents.
The sad thing is, many of these awful events could easily be prevented with 
the knowledge and intervention of parents. We want to give this opportunity
to such guardians.

This number could be greatly reduced with some realtime updates of a child's 
position en route. 

Our application seeks to execute this solution in the most intuitive way possible.
It's easy to set up, and it is quite lit.

Here's how it all works:
